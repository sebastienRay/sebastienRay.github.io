And clients are more and more demanding nowadays. The feature around 2:40 and 3:50 will be useful to show off in future meetings. Showcasing design will probably be changing a lot in the next few years. The concurrence between XD, Figma, Sketch and other prototype maker is and will be fierce and showcasing abilities could be a decision maker. XD is still a bit late on this but has made a lot of notable updates theses last few months. Let&rsquo;s see how things are in a year or so.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/ux>UX</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
