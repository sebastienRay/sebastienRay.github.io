It was during a course named UXLab, and we learned how to do an UX interview using exe tracking and how to analyse the results. That day I went back thinking how I could apply the new knowledge to my activity with Niseko(my agency). Most of our clients are small PME and don&rsquo;t have budgets allowing crazy UX field testing. But I realized that our own website could be an interesting way of seeing the result of a real eye test. Maybe we could learn something, who knows.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/95vjmy2Gq9w style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Here are the results of a middle aged women, who didn&rsquo;t know anything about Niseko nor UX design in general. There are a few points which went in the way of the test.
-It was 10 seconds max for the free version.
-The page took way more time than usual to load.
-She couldn&rsquo;t see the whole site due to time.</p><p>But here are a few takes on the results:
-She never looks at the right side of the website.
-She doesn&rsquo;t take the time to read the text.
-She never looks at the blob on the sides.
-She takes time on the logo of our clients.</p><p>I needed a bit more theory on the subject to be able to understand those results. I found this article &ldquo;<a href=https://uxdesign.cc/ux-psychology-go-hand-in-hand-introduction-to-human-attention-a70ffd2c4289>UX & Psychology go hand in hand — Introduction to human attention</a>&rdquo; by Norbi Gaal.I needed a bit more theory on the subject to be able to understand those results.</p><p>The objective of this article is not to go through every detail of the results or the article but to raise questions. For this process to be fully pertinent and have concrete results it would need a larger scale of subjects doing the test. But even with that in mind we can still see the possibilities that offer eye tracking and we can already imagine what are the weakness of the &ldquo;<a href=www.niseko.ch>niseko</a>&rdquo; website. Expending this practice to client&rsquo;s website could be possible if for example, the target is very specific (child/old people). And more than just website, the experiment would make sens with ads or video.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/ux>UX</a></li><li><a href=/tags/eyetracking>eyetracking</a></li><li><a href=/tags/website>website</a></li><li><a href=/tags/user>user</a></li><li><a href=/tags/experience>experience</a></li><li><a href=/tags/test>test</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
