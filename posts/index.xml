So I went on youtube to Howard Pinsky&amp;rsquo;s channel where I always fin everything about XD.
In my agency we mostly use Adobe XD to show the web design to the client before starting to code. And clients are more and more demanding nowadays. The feature around 2:40 and 3:50 will be useful to show off in future meetings.</description></item><item><title>Use `console.log()` Like a Pro</title><link>http://example.org/posts/consolelog/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2020 17:46:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/posts/consolelog/</guid><description>I saw this tweet the other day and left it aside to read it later.

&amp;mdash; JavaScript Daily (@JavaScriptDaily) December 1, 2020 I won&amp;rsquo;t lie to you, I don&amp;rsquo;t code a lot. I code as less as possible. My associate is way better than me and it&amp;rsquo;s just not really my thing. But I still deal with a lot of code for projects and I have to understand it.</description></item></channel></rss>
