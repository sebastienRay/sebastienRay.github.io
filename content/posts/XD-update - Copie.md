In my agency we mostly use Adobe XD to show the web design to the client before starting to code. And clients are more and more demanding nowadays. The feature around 2:40 and 3:50 will be useful to show off in future meetings. Showcasing design will probably be changing a lot in the next few years. The concurrence between XD, Figma, Sketch and other prototype maker is and will be fierce and showcasing abilities could be a decision maker. XD is still a bit late on this but has made a lot of notable updates theses last few months. Let's see how things are in a year or so.
