Algorithm-driven design tools can help us to construct a UI, prepare graphic assets and content, and personalize the user experience but can they replace us?

While I was browsing trough the "[2021 UI/UX Design Trends and How To Make Them Work For You](https://uxplanet.org/2021-ui-ux-design-trends-and-how-to-make-them-work-for-you-49d8a04fb09b)" article by Kate Shokurova which I recommend you take a look at. At the end of chapter "#2 AI and other tools to the rescue" the authoress talks about the usage of AI in UX/UI. She link a list of "[AI design](https://algorithms.design/)" tools collected by Yury Vetrov. This website is amazing, you can find a lot of examples of AI's impact on design in the different category(Constructing a UI, Preparing assets and content, Personalizing UX, Graphic Design, ...).

Here are a few interesting examples in my opinion:

## "[Looka](https://looka.com/)"
Looka is a tool replacing my fellow graphic designer freelancer. Their AI is able to design a simple logo based on your favorites styles and colors.

## "[Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/extracting-image-metadata-at-scale-c89c60a2b9d2)"
A script using AI crops movie scene for posters, then applies a stylized and localized movie title, then runs "[automatic experiments on a subset of users](https://netflixtechblog.com/artwork-personalization-c589f074ad76)". So when you're scrolling trough Netflix, you see a personalized version of the cover for each movie/series. Insane.

## "[Firedrop](https://firedrop.ai/)"
Firedrop helps you by creating content by doing A.I Design Generation. You provide the content, then it helps you to create a layout and choose a visual style.
