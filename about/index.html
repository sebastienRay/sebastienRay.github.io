While I was trying to reduce the scope of my technological watch, I figured I didn&rsquo;t have a very specific domain of interest. I created my own agency two years ago and during this time I&rsquo;ve used knowledge in every domain even if my associate is more the tech guy.

I created my own agency two years ago and during this time I&rsquo;ve used knowledge in every domain even if my associate is more the tech guy. The more experience I get the more I realize I want to stay open and have the manager/supervision kind of position. I think this kind of position needs a good vision of the market and of the technology.</p><p>The focus will be on two domains: Web design and Business strategy. I will share a lot of my experience with Niseko to be able to reflect on my mistakes and to be able to see my development as an entrepreneur.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
